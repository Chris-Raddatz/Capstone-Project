DataQuest Data Analyst Capstone Project


As a capstone project for the DataQuest Data Analyst Path, I took a dataset from Kaggle documenting imdb Ratings for thousands of video games on their database. 
I cleaned the data with Pandas and prepped visuals with Seaborn and Matplotlib, in an attempt to identify popular genres, certificates and trends throughout the history of video-games. 
The best genres were Action and Adventure, while the most negatively reviewed genre was Family games. T and M certificate games were more likely to have higher ratings and votes as well. 
This indicates that the best course of action when attempting to design a popular video game is to create one that focuses on Action and Adventure, and includes more mature
subjects to garner a Teen (T) or Mature (M) certificate.
